# Rough-draft-hangman
This is the beginning of a hangman game. I am hoping to create a two player game without a word bank and with an actual stick body. 
This is pretty basic and uses what we have learned in class to create a game that outputs a beginning message to the user and shows the user how many lives they have left and asks the user for their input (the letter they guess). This also stores a small word bank that is randomized by the computer so the actual player doesn't know what the word is. I also am planning to present to the player how many letters are in the word (part of the game) but haven't done so yet. This is the very beginning of what it will look like.
